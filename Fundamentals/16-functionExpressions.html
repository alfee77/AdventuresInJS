                <h2>Function Expressions</h2>
                <p> The classical way to write a function looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code>
    function sayHi(){ 
        alert(`Hi!`); 
    } 
                </code></pre>
                <p>The function is declared, assigned a name, any arguments are defined in the parenthesis, and the body of 
                the function's code is embedded in the curly brackets {}. This code may then be assigned to the onclick attribute
                of an HTML button, and off you go!</p>
                <p>Click this button to say "Hi!"</p>
                <button onclick="sayHi()">Say Hi!</button>
                
                
                <p> However, it is also possible to create a function in runtime "on the hoof". Examine the following code:</p>
                <pre><code>
    let sayHello = function(){ 
        alert(`Hello!`);
    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>This function is <i>created</i> on the assignment side of an expression (i.e. to the right
                    hand side of the <code>=</code>), and is immediately assigned to the variable <code>sayHello</code>.
                </p>
                <p>Click this button to say "Hello!"</p>
                <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello!</button>

                

                <p>At first glance it may appear that this is two different ways of achieving the same thing. However, the tutorial
                    promises that "in more advanced situations, that weâ€™ll come across later, a function may be created and
                    immediately called or scheduled for a later execution, not stored anywhere, thus remaining anonymous."
                </p>

                <h3>Function is a value</h3>
                <p>You what now? As a function can be assigned as the contents to a variable, when we refer to that function as a variable (i.e. without the parenthisis), the contents of the function are returned as a string. </p>
                <button onclick="retContentsofSayHifunc()">contents of sayHi() function</button>
                <p><code id="demo"><br></code></p>
                
                <button onclick="retContentsofSayHellofunc()">contents of sayHello() function</button>
                <p><code id="demo1"><br></code></p>
                
                <h3>Callback Functions</h3>

                <p>We can make use of this phenomena. When clicked the following button will ask the user for an answer, and depending on the answer given will direct the code to a given function.</p>
                
                <p>The code looks like this:</p>
                <pre><code>
    function ask(question, yes, no) { 
        let answer = confirm(question); 
        if (answer) yes() 
        else no();    
    } 
                      
    function clickedOk() { 
        alert( "You agreed." ); 
    } 
                      
    function clickedCancel() { 
        alert( "You canceled the execution." ); 
    } 
                </code></pre>

                <p>When the function <code>ask()</code> is called, it is done so in the following form:</p>
                <pre><code>
    ask('Do you agree?', clickedOK, clickedCancel);
                </code></pre>
                <p>Observations: </p>
                <p>When the function <code>ask()</code> is declared, it is defined with 3 arguments; <code>"question"</code>, <code>"yes" and "no"</code>. 
                    Due to JavaScript's loosely typed nature, these arguments aren't typed when they are declared. The content of the function is very 
                    simple; present the user with a Yes/No "question", the text of which is the first argument passed to the ask function, and act depending 
                    on the answer. The answer is gathered by means of a confirmation box, delivered by the <code>confirm()</code> function. If the user 
                    clicks "Yes", the <code>confirm()</code> function returns truthy; in this condition the function <code>yes()</code> is called (the 
                    second argument passed to the function). If the user clicks "No", the confirm function returns falsy; in this condition the 
                    <code>no()</code> function is called (the third argument passed to the function).</p>
                <p>This function call is added to the onclick attribute of the following button.</p>
                <button onclick="ask('Do you agree?', clickedOk, clickedCancel);">Ask</button>
