            <h2>Data Types</h2>

            <p>A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.</p>

            <p>There are eight basic data types in JavaScript; Number, BigInt, String, Boolean, Null and Undefined,
                Objects and Symbols.</p>

            <p>We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a
                number:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
<span class="comment">// no error</span>
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;

            </div>
            <p>Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning
                that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.</p>

            <h3>Number</h3>

            <div class="codeLines">
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;

            </div>

            <p>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.</p>

            <p>There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and
                so on.</p>

            <p>Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data
                type: <code>Infinity</code>, <code>-Infinity</code> and <code>NaN</code>.</p>

            <p><code>Infinity</code> represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than
                any number.</p>

            <p>We can get it as a result of division by zero:</p>

            <div class=codeLines>
alert( 1 / 0 ); <span class="comment">// Infinity</span>

            </div>

            <p>Or just reference it directly:</p>

            <div class=codeLines>
alert( Infinity ); <span class="comment">// Infinity</span>

            </div>

            <p><code>NaN</code> represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined
                mathematical operation, for instance:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
alert( "not a number" / 2 ); <span class="comment">// NaN, such division is erroneous</span>

            </div>

            <p><code>NaN</code> is sticky. Any further mathematical operation on <code>NaN</code> returns
                <code>NaN</code>:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
alert( NaN + 1 ); <span class="comment">// NaN</span>
alert( 3 * NaN ); <span class="comment">// NaN</span>
alert( "not a number" / 2 - 1 ); // NaN

            </div>

            <p>So, if there’s a <code>NaN</code> somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole
                result (there’s only one exception to that: <code>NaN ** 0</code> is <code>1</code>).</p>

            <div class="info">
                <p>ℹ️<strong> Mathematical operations are safe</p></strong>
                <p>Doing maths is “safe” in JavaScript. We can do anything: divide by zero, treat non-numeric strings as
                    numbers, etc. The script will never stop with a fatal error (“die”). At worst, we’ll get
                    <code>NaN</code> as the result.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Special numeric values formally belong to the “number” type. Of course they are not numbers in the common
                sense of this word.</p>

            <p>We’ll see more about working with numbers in the chapter Numbers.</p>

            <h3>BigInt</h3>
            <p>In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot safely represent integer values larger than (2<sup>53</sup>-1)
                (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(2<sup>53</sup>-1) for negatives.</p>

            <p>To be really precise, the “number” type can store larger integers (up to 1.7976931348623157 * 10308), but
                outside of the safe integer range ±(2<sup>53</sup>-1) there’ll be a precision error, because not all
                digits fit into the fixed 64-bit storage. So an “approximate” value may be stored.</p>

            <p>For example, these two numbers (right above the safe range) are the same:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
console.log(9007199254740991 + 1); <span class="comment">// 9007199254740992</span>
console.log(9007199254740991 + 2); <span class="comment">// 9007199254740992</span>

            </div>
            <p>So to say, all odd integers greater than (2<sup>53</sup>-1) can’t be stored at all in the “number” type.
            </p>

            <p>For most purposes ±(2<sup>53</sup>-1) range is quite enough, but sometimes we need the entire range of
                really big integers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.</p>

            <p><code>BigInt</code> type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.
            </p>

            <p>A <code>BigInt</code> value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
<span class="comment">// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt</span>
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

            </div>

            <p>As <code>BigInt</code> numbers are rarely needed, we don’t cover them here, but devoted them a separate
                chapter <code>BigInt</code>. Read it when you need such big numbers.</p>

            <h3>String</h3>
            <p>A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;

            </div>
            <p>In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Double quotes: "Hello".</li>
                <li>Single quotes: 'Hello'.</li>
                <li>Backticks: `Hello`.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in
                JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a
                string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let name = "John";

<span class="comment">// embed a variable</span>
alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); <span class="comment">// Hello, John!</span>

<span class="comment">// embed an expression</span>
alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); <span class="comment">// the result is 3</span>

            </div>
            <p>The expression inside <code>${…}</code> is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string. We can
                put anything in there: a variable like name or an arithmetical expression like 1 + 2 or something more
                complex.</p>

            <p>Please note that this can only be done in backticks. Other quotes don’t have this embedding
                functionality!</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
alert( "the result is ${1 + 2}" ); // the result is ${1 + 2} (double quotes do nothing)

            </div>

            <p>We’ll cover strings more thoroughly in the chapter Strings.</p>

            <div class="info">
                <p>ℹ️<strong> There is no character type.</strong></p>
                <p>In some languages, there is a special “character” type for a single character. For example, in the C
                    language and in Java it is called “char”.</p>

                <p>In JavaScript, there is no such type. There’s only one type: string. A string may consist of zero
                    characters (be empty), one character or many of them.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Boolean (logical type)</h3>
            <p>The <code>boolean</code> type has only two values: true and false.</p>

            <p>This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no,
                incorrect”.</p>

            <p>For instance:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let nameFieldChecked = true; <span class="comment">// yes, name field is checked</span>
let ageFieldChecked = false; <span class="comment">// no, age field is not checked</span>

            </div>
            <p>Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert( isGreater ); <span class="comment">// true (the comparison result is "yes")</span>

            </div>
            <p>We’ll cover booleans more deeply in the chapter Logical operators.</p>

            <h3>The “null” value</h3>
            <p>The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.</p>

            <p>It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let age = null;

            </div>
            <p>In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other
                languages.</p>

            <p>It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.</p>

            <p>The code above states that age is unknown.</p>

            <h3>The “undefined” value</h3>
            <p>The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.</p>

            <p>The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.</p>

            <p>If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let age;

alert(age); <span class="comment">// shows "undefined"</span>

            </div>
            <p>Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let age = 100;

<span class="comment">// change the value to undefined</span>
age = undefined;

alert(age); <span class="comment">// "undefined"</span>

            </div>
            <p>…But we don’t recommend doing that. Normally, one uses null to assign an “empty” or “unknown” value to a
                variable, while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.</p>

            <h3>Objects and Symbols</h3>
            <p>The <code>object</code> type is special.</p>

            <p>All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a
                string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more
                complex entities.</p>

            <p>Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment. We’ll deal with them later in the chapter
                Objects, after we learn more about primitives.</p>

            <p>The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake
                of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.</p>

            <h3>The <code>typeof</code> operator</h3>
            <p>The <code>typeof</code> operator returns the type of the operand. It’s useful when we want to process values of
                different types differently or just want to do a quick check.</p>

            <p>A call to <code>typeof x</code> returns a string with the type name:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
typeof undefined <span class="comment">// "undefined"</span>

typeof 0 <span class="comment">// "number"</span>

typeof 10n <span class="comment">// "bigint"</span>

typeof true <span class="comment">// "boolean"</span>

typeof "foo" <span class="comment">// "string"</span>

typeof Symbol("id") <span class="comment">// "symbol"</span>

typeof Math <span class="comment">// "object" (1)</span>

typeof null <span class="comment">// "object" (2)</span>

typeof alert <span class="comment">// "function" (3)</span>
            </div>

            <p>The last three lines may need additional explanation:</p>

            <p>
                Math is a built-in object that provides mathematical operations. We will learn it in the chapter Numbers.
                Here, it serves just as an example of an object.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result of typeof null is "object". That’s an officially recognized error in typeof, coming from very
                early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, null is not an object. It is a special
                value with a separate type of its own. The behavior of typeof is wrong here.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result of typeof alert is "function", because alert is a function. We’ll study functions in the next
                chapters where we’ll also see that there’s no special “function” type in JavaScript. Functions belong to the
                object type. But typeof treats them differently, returning "function". That also comes from the early days
                of JavaScript. Technically, such behavior isn’t correct, but can be convenient in practice.
            </p>
            <div class="info">
                
                <p>ℹ️<strong> The <code>typeof(x)</code> syntax</strong></p>
                
                <p>You may also come across another syntax: <code>typeof(x)</code>. It’s the same as <code>typeof x</code>.
                    To be clear: <code>typeof</code> is an operator, not a function. The parentheses here aren’t a part of typeof. It’s
                    the kind of parentheses used for mathematical grouping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usually, such parentheses contain a mathematical expression, such as (2 + 2), but here they contain only one
                    argument (x). Syntactically, they allow to avoid a space between the <code>typeof</code> operator and its argument, and
                    some people like it.
                </p>
                <p>Some people prefer <code>typeof(x)</code>, although the <code>typeof x</code> syntax is much more common.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Seven primitive data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>number</code> for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(2<sup>53</sup>-1).</li>
                <li><code>bigint</code> for integer numbers of arbitrary length.</li>
                <li><code>string</code> for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.</li>
                <li><code>boolean</code> for true/false.</li>
                <li><code>null</code> for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.</li>
                <li><code>undefined</code> for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.</li>
                <li><code>symbol</code> for unique identifiers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And one non-primitive data type:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>object for more complex data structures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable. Usually used as typeof x, 
                but typeof(x) is also possible. Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string". For null returns
                 "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object. In the next chapters, we’ll 
                 concentrate on primitive values and once we’re familiar with them, we’ll move on to objects.
