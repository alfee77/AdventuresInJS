            <h1>Methods of primitives</h1>
            <p>Quick reminder as to what the primitive data types in JavaScript are:</p>
            <p><code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>bigint</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>symbol</code>,
                <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript allows us to work with primitives as if they were objects - epic :). However, primitives are
                <i>not</i> objects. Primitive variables are capable of storing a single data type, unlike objects which
                can have multiple values as properties. One of the best things about an object is we can store a
                function as a property:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
    let myCar = {
        manufacturer: "Kia",
        model: "Niro",
        Date of registration: 30/09/2021,
        tootHorn(){
            alert(`Beep beep!`);
        }
    }

    function example1(){
        myCar.tootHorn();
    }

    <button onclick="example1()">Run</button>
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>So here's an example of an object, <code>myCar{...}</code> with the method tootHorn. I mean what kind of
                a car doesn't have a horn eh? One must be able to toot.</p>
            <p>Many inbuilt objects exist in JavaScript. For example, Dates, errors, DOM and HTML elements etc. Much
                like <code>myCar</code>, these objects come with their own properties, many of which are methods.
                However, it must be born in mind that objects are "heavier" than primitives. They require a bit more
                "under the hood" to come into existence.</p>
