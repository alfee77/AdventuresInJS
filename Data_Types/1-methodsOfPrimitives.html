            <h1>Methods of primitives</h1>
            <p>Quick reminder as to what the primitive data types in JavaScript are:</p>
            <p><code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>bigint</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>symbol</code>,
                <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript allows us to work with primitives as if they were objects - epic :). However, primitives are
                <i>not</i> objects. Primitive variables are capable of storing a single data type, unlike objects which
                can have multiple values as properties. One of the best things about an object is we can store a
                function as a property:
            </p>
            <div class="codeLines">
let myCar = {
    manufacturer: "Kia",
    model: "Niro",
    Date of registration: 30/09/2021,
    tootHorn(){
        alert(`Beep beep! said the ${this.manufacturer} ${this.model}`);
    }
}

function example1(){
    myCar.tootHorn();
}

<button onclick="example1()">Run</button>
            </div>
            <p>So here's an example of an object, <code>myCar{...}</code> with the method <code>tootHorn()</code>. I
                mean what kind of a car doesn't have a horn eh? One must be able to toot.</p>
            <p>Many inbuilt objects exist in JavaScript. For example, Dates, errors, DOM and HTML elements etc. Much
                like <code>myCar</code>, these objects come with their own properties, many of which are methods.
                However, it must be born in mind that objects are "heavier" than primitives. They require a bit more
                "under the hood" to come into existence.</p>

            <p>So the paradox facing the original developer of JavaScript is; yeh - lets have primitive data types
                that hold simple/low overhead variables, but how do we give these things methods to carry
                day to day operations on it?
            </p>

            <p>The solution looks a little bit awkward, but here it is:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Primitives are still primitive. A single value, as desired.</li>
                <li>The language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, booleans and symbols.</li>
                <li>In order for that to work, a special “object wrapper” that provides the extra functionality is
                    created, and then is destroyed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To allow access to the methods and properties of these primitive data types, the language provides
                wrapper objects, namely
                <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Bigint</code>, <code>Boolean</code> and
                <code>Symbol</code>. Consider the following which implicitly cracks into the String object wrapper:
            </p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let str = "Hello";

alert( str.toUpperCase() ); <span class="comment">// HELLO</span>

<button onclick="example2()">Run</button>
            </div>
            <p>Note it is not necessary to explicitly wrap the String in the object wrapper; the methods are available
                implicitly.</p>


            <div class="task">
                <h2>Tasks</h2>

                <h3>Task 1 - adding properties to a primitive?</h3>
                <p>Consider the following code:</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
function task1(){
    let hello = "hi";
    hello.test = 5;

    alert(hello.test);
}

<button onclick="task1()">Run</button>
        
                </div>
                <p>What do you think? Will it work?</p>
                <div class="task-solution">
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>If the <code>'use strict'</code> directive is used, running this code will result in an error. Otherwise, running this code will
                    post "undefined" in the alert box. This is because the object wrapper is created when the value 5 is 
                    added to the hello.test property, however as soon as the value is applied the object wrapper is disposed of.</p>
