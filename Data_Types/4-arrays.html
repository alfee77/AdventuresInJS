                <h2>Arrays</h2>
                <p>Objects allow you to store keyed collections of values; this is fine and dandy, but sometimes we need to store things
                    in an ordered fashion. Objects dont provide methods for ordering such an ordered collection. Arrays are a special data structure
                    that is used to store these sorts of collections.
                </p>
                <h3>Declaration</h3>
                <p>JavaScript provides two syntaxes for creating empty arrays:</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
let arr = new Array();
let arr = [];
                </div>
                <p>Almost all of the time the second syntax is used. The array can be initialised with stuff in the brackets:</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];
                </div>
                <p>Array elements are numbered, starting at 0. We can access an element by putting it's number in the square brackets:</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

alert(vegetables[0]); <span class="comment">//Potato</span>
alert(vegetables[1]); <span class="comment">//Tomato</span>
alert(vegetables[2]); <span class="comment">//Pepper</span>
                </div>
                <p>We can replace an element:</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
vegetables[2] = Carrot <span class="comment">//now ["Potato, "Tomato", "Carrot"]</span>
                </div>
                <p>...Or add a new one to the array:</p>
            <div class="codeLines">
vegetables[3] = "Mushrooms"; <span class="comment">//now ["Potato, "Tomato", "Carrot", "Mushrooms"] </span>
                </div>
                <p>The total count of the array is its <code>length</code>:</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

alert(vegetables.length); <span class="comment">//3</span>
                </div>
                <p>We can also use <code>alert</code> to show the whole array:</p>
        
                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

alert(vegetables); <span class="comment">//Potato, Tomato, Pepper</span>
                </div>

                <p>An array can store elements of any type. For instance:</p>

                <div class="codeLines">
<span class="comment">//mix of values</span>
let arr = ["Potato", { name: "Alistair"}, true, function() { alert("Hello!")}];

<span class="comment">//get the object at index 1, and then alert the value associated with the "name" key:</span>
alert(arr[1].name);

<span class="comment">//get the function at index 3 and run it:</span>
arr[3]();

<button onclick="example1()">Run</button>
                </div>
                <div class="info">
                    <p>ℹ️<strong> Trailing comma</p></strong>
                    <p>In JavaScript, an array, just like an object, may end with a trailing comma:</p>
                    <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = [
    "Potato",
    "Tomato",
    "Pepper",
];
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Get last elements with "at"</h3>
                <div class="info">
                    <p>⚠️<strong> A recent addition to JavaScript</p></strong>
                    <p>This is a recent addition to the language. Old browsers may need polyfills.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Let’s say we want the last element of the array.</p>

                <p>Some programming languages allow the use of negative indexes for the same purpose, like vegetables[-1].</p>

                <p>Although, in JavaScript it won’t work. The result will be undefined, because the 
                    index in square brackets is treated literally.</p>

                <p>We can explicitly calculate the last element index and then access it: <code>vegetables[vegetables.length - 1]</code>.</p>

                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

alert( vegetables[vegetables.length-1] ); <span class="comment">// Plum</span>
                </div>
<p>Perhaps this is a bit cumbersome (although I'm not sure I agree)? There’s a shorter
    syntax: vegetables.at(-1):</p>

<div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

<span class="comment">// same as vegetables[vegetables.length-1]</span>
alert( vegetables.at(-1) ); // Pepper
</div>
                <p>In other words, <code>arr.at(i)</code>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>is exactly the same as arr[i], if i >= 0.</li>
                    <li>for negative values of i, it steps back from the end of the array.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Queues, stacks and deques</h3>
                <p>Arrays can be used to facilitate queues, stacks and deques. JavaScript provides 
                methods to support these data structures, including methods pop/push, shift/unshift.</p>
                <h4>Queue</h4>
                <p>In computing science, a queue is something that adds an element to the end of the
                queue via the <code>push()</code> method, and bumps off the element at the front of the queue via the
                <code>shift()</code> method. (note the <code>deshift()</code> method allows you to put it, or something 
                else, back on) Think of a queue as a left-to-right entity, following a first-in last-out rule set:</p>
                <img src="images/queue.png" alt="">

                <h4>Stack</h4>
                <p>A stack is something that has elements added to the top of it via the <code>push()</code> method, and 
                then taken off the top via the <code>pop()</code> method. Think of a stack as a top down entity, following 
                a first-in first-out rule set:</p>
                <img src="images/stack.png" alt="">
                <p>Looking at each of these methods in turn.</p>
                <h4>pop()</h4>
                <p>See below our example array. If we call the <code>pop()</code> method, it will extract the last item (Pepper) from the list. 
                The <code>pop()</code> method returns whatever is at the top of the array (in this case, the string "Pepper"), and leaves the array
                bereft of it's last item:</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

alert(vegetables.pop());

alert(vegetables);

<button onclick="example2()">Run</button>
                </div>

                <h4>push()</h4>
                <p>Sticking with the trusty <code>vegetables[]</code>, calling the push method and passing an argument to it causes 
                the array to grow!</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

vegetables.push("Carrot");

alert(vegetables);

<button onclick="example3()">Run</button>
                </div>
                <h4>shift()</h4>
                <p>These <code>vegetables[]</code> have seen some action!. Calling the <code>shift()</code> method rips the fella from the front 
                of the queue:</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

alert(vegetables.shift());

alert(vegetables);

<button onclick="example4()">Run</button>
                </div>
                <p>Note: <code>shift()</code>, like <code>pop()</code>, returns whatever is sitting at the front of the queue.</p>

                <h4>unshift()</h4>
                <p>I dunno what's going to happen here, so lets run with it!</p>
                <div class="codeLines">
let vegetables = ["Potato", "Tomato", "Pepper"];

alert(vegetables.unshift("Artichoke"));

alert(vegetables);

<button onclick="example5()">Run</button>
                </div>
                <h3>Internals</h3>

                <p>An array is a special kind of object. The square brackets used to access a property arr[0] actually come from
                the object syntax. That’s essentially the same as obj[key], where arr is the object, while numbers are used as keys.</p>
                
                <p>They extend objects providing special methods to work with ordered collections of data and also the length property. 
                But at the core it’s still an object.</p>
                
                <p>Remember, there are only eight basic data types in JavaScript (see the Data types chapter for more info). Array is 
                an object and thus behaves like an object.</p>
                
                <p>For instance, it is copied by reference:</p>
                
                <div class="codeLines">
let fruits = ["Banana"]

let arr = fruits; <span class="comment">// copy by reference (two variables reference the same array)</span>

alert( arr === fruits ); <span class="comment">// true</span>

arr.push("Pear"); <span class="comment">// modify the array by reference</span>

alert( fruits ); <span class="comment">// Banana, Pear - 2 items now</span>
                </div>
                <p>…But what makes arrays really special is their internal representation. The engine tries to store its elements 
                in the contiguous memory area, one after another, just as depicted on the illustrations in this chapter, and there
                are other optimizations as well, to make arrays work really fast.</p>
                
                <p>But they all break if we quit working with an array as with an “ordered collection” and start working with it as 
                if it were a regular object.</p>
                
                <p>For instance, technically we can do this:</p>
                
                <div class="codeLines">
let fruits = []; <span class="comment">// make an array</span>

fruits[99999] = 5; <span class="comment">// assign a property with the index far greater than its length</span>

fruits.age = 25; <span class="comment">// create a property with an arbitrary name</span>
                </div>
                <p>That’s possible, because arrays are objects at their base. We can add any properties to them.<em>However</em> the engine
                will see that we’re working with the array as with a regular object. Array-specific optimizations are not suited for 
                such cases and will be turned off, their benefits disappear.</p>
                
                <p>The ways to misuse an array:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a non-numeric property like <code>arr.test = 5</code>.</li>
                    <li>Make holes, like: add <code>arr[0]</code> and then <code>arr[1000] </code>(and nothing between them).</li>
                    <li>Fill the array in the reverse order, like <code>arr[1000]</code>, <code>arr[999]</code> and so on.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You MUST think of arrays as special structures to work with the ordered data. They provide special methods 
                for that. Arrays are carefully tuned inside JavaScript engines to work with contiguous ordered data, please use 
                them this way. And if you need arbitrary keys, chances are high that you actually require a regular object {}.</p>
