            <h2>Objects - the basics</h2>
            <h3>Object Literals</h3>
            <p>The easiest way to create an object is to use an object literal. Simply put, it's a comma separated list
                of <code>name:value</code> pairs,
                enclosed within curly braces. Some examples:</p>
            <div class="codeLines">
let empty = null; <span class="comment">//An empty object </span>
let point = { <span class="comment">//An object with two numeric valies</span>
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
};

let book = { <span class="comment">//A more complex object</span>
    author: { <span class="comment">//the value of this property is itself</span>
        firstname: "David", <span class="comment">//an object - cooooool!</span>
        surname: "Flanagan"
    },
    for: "all audiences",
    "main title": "JavaScript", <span class="comment">//These property names include spaces,</span>
    "sub-title": "The Definitive Guide", <span class="comment">//and hyphens, so use string literals</span>
};
            </div>

            <h3> Create objects with <code>new</code></h3>
            <p>The <code>new</code> operator creates and initializes a new object. The new keyword must be followed by a
                function invocation. A function used in this
                way is called a <em>constructor</em>. JavaScript includes constructors for its own built-in types:</p>
            <div class="codeLines">
let o = new Object(); <span class="comment">//Create an empty object, the same as {}</span>
let a = new Array(); <span class="comment">//Create an empty array, the same as []</span>
let d = new Date(); <span class="comment">//Create a Date object representing the current time</span>
let r = new Map(); <span class="comment">//creates a Map object for key value mapping</span>
            </div>

            <h3>Prototypes - a good place to pause!!</h3>
            <p>In JavaScript, objects have a special hidden property [[Prototype]] (as named in the specification), that
            is either null or references another object. That object is called “a prototype”:</p>

            <p>When we read a property from object, and it’s missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype.
            In programming, this is called “prototypal inheritance”. And soon we’ll study many examples of such
            inheritance, as well as cooler language features built upon it.</p>

            <p>The property [[Prototype]] is internal and hidden, but there are many ways to set it.</p>

            <p>One of them is to use the special name __proto__, like this:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let animal = {
    eats: true
};
let rabbit = {
    jumps: true
};

rabbit.__proto__ = animal; <span class="comment">// sets rabbit.[[Prototype]] = animal;</span>

            </div>

            <p>Now if we read a property from rabbit, and it’s missing, JavaScript will automatically take it from animal.</p>

            <p>For instance:</p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let animal = {
    eats: true
};
let rabbit = {
    jumps: true
};

rabbit.__proto__ = animal; <span class="comment">// (*)</span>

<span class="comment">// we can find both properties in rabbit now:</span>
alert( rabbit.eats ); <span class="comment">// true (**)</span>
alert( rabbit.jumps ); <span class="comment">// true</span>
            </div>
            
            <p>Here the line (*) sets animal to be the prototype of rabbit.</p>

            <p>Then, when alert tries to read property rabbit.eats (**), it’s not in rabbit, so JavaScript follows the
            <code>[[Prototype]]</code> reference and finds it in animal (look from the bottom up):</p>


            <p>Here we can say that “animal is the prototype of rabbit” or “rabbit prototypically inherits from animal”.</p>

            <p>So if animal has a lot of useful properties and methods, then they become automatically available in rabbit.
            Such properties are called “inherited”.</p>

            <p>If we have a method in animal, it can be called on rabbit:</p>
            <div class="codeLines">
let animal = {
    eats: true,
    walk() {
        alert("Animal walk");
    }
};

let rabbit = {
    jumps: true,
    __proto__: animal
};

<span class="comment">// walk is taken from the prototype</span>
rabbit.walk(); <span class="comment">// Animal walk</span>
            </div>

            <p>The method is automatically taken from the prototype, like this:</p>

            <img src='images/prototype1.png' alt=''>

            <p>The prototype chain can be longer:</p>

<div class="codeLines">
let animal = {
    eats: true,
    walk() {
        alert("Animal walk");
    }
};

let rabbit = {
    jumps: true,
    __proto__: animal
};

let longEar = {
    earLength: 10,
    __proto__: rabbit
};

<span class="comment">// walk is taken from the prototype chain</span>
longEar.walk(); <span class="comment">// Animal walk</span>
alert(longEar.jumps); <span class="comment">// true (from rabbit)</span>

            </div>

            <img src='images/prototype2.png' alt=''>
            <p>Now if we read something from longEar, and it’s missing, JavaScript will look for it in rabbit, and then in animal.</p>

            <p>There are only two limitations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The references can’t go in circles. JavaScript will throw an error if we try to assign __proto__ in a circle.</li>
                <li>The value of __proto__ can be either an object or null. Other types are ignored.</li>
                <li>Also it may be obvious, but still: there can be only one [[Prototype]]. An object may not inherit from two others.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>__proto__ is a historical getter/setter for [[Prototype]]</p>
            <p>It’s a common mistake of novice developers not to know the difference between these two.</p>

            <div  class="info">
                <p>Please note that __proto__ is not the same as the internal [[Prototype]] property. It’s a getter/setter for [[Prototype]]. Later we’ll see situations where it matters, for now let’s just keep it in mind, as we build our understanding of JavaScript language.</p>

                <p>The __proto__ property is a bit outdated. It exists for historical reasons, modern JavaScript suggests that we should use Object.getPrototypeOf/Object.setPrototypeOf functions instead that get/set the prototype. We’ll also cover these functions later.</p>

                <p>By the specification, __proto__ must only be supported by browsers. In fact though, all environments including server-side support __proto__, so we’re quite safe using it.</p>

                <p>As the __proto__ notation is a bit more intuitively obvious, we use it in the examples.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>I'll start with the most startling observation (for me); objects in JavaScript are very different in form
                to objects in Java. Prior to learning JavaScript my understanding of an object was it represented an instantiated 
                class, where a class represented a blueprint of a given object type. The class would define methods (functions) 
                to access its member variables; methods would effectively act as the public access point to modify member variables. 
                This is not what a JavaScript object is; it is more akin to a data dictionary in Python, where it uses key: value 
                pairs to define object properties. So an object that represents a user, would look something like: </p>

            <div class="codeLines">
let user = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    isAdmin: true
}
            </div>
            <p>Functions can be set as properties of an object. When they are, they are referred to as a <em>methods</em>. Methods 
            are studied in the next chapter. </p>

            <p>Objects are associative arrays with several special features.</p>

            <p>They store properties (key-value pairs), where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).</li>
                <li>Values can be of any type.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To access a property, we can use:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The dot notation: <code>obj.property.</code></li>
                <li>Square brackets notation <code>obj["property"]</code>. Square brackets allow taking the key from a
                    variable, like <code>obj[varWithKey]</code>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Additional operators:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To delete a property: <code>delete obj.prop</code>.</li>
                <li>To check if a property with the given key exists: <code>"key" in obj</code>.</li>
                <li>To iterate over an object: <code>for (let key in obj)</code> loop.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What we’ve studied in this chapter is called a “plain object”, or just Object.
                There are many other kinds of objects in JavaScript:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Array to store ordered data collections,</li>
                <li>Date to store the information about the date and time,</li>
                <li>Error to store the information about an error.</li>
                <li>…And so on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They have their special features that we’ll study later. Sometimes people say something like “Array type”
                or “Date type”, but formally they are not types of their own, but belong to a single “object” data type.
                And they extend it in various ways.</p>

            <p>Objects in JavaScript are very powerful. Here we’ve just scratched the surface of a topic that is really
                huge. We’ll be closely working with objects and learning more about them in further parts of the
                tutorial.</p>
