            <h2>Object methods and the "this" keyword</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on:

            <pre><code>
    let user = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30
    };

</code></pre>
            <p>And, in the real world, a user can act: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.</p>

            <p>Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties. A function that is a property of an
                object is referred to as a <em>method</em>.</p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p>Lets give the above user the ability to say "Hi!"</p>
            <pre><code>
    let user = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30
    };
              
    user.sayHi = function(){
        alert("Hi!");
    }
            
    user.sayHi();
    
    <button onclick="example1()">Run</button>
        </code></pre>

            <p>So going back to the notes on creating functions on the hoof, this is an example of doing something in
                code. The sayHi() function is added to the object user
                in runtime. Examine closely how user.sayHi isnt created when the object is created, but afterwards.</p>

            <p>It's acceptable to declare a function traditionally, and then add it to the object:</p>
            <pre><code>
    let user = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30
    };

    function sayHi(){
        alert("Hi!");
    }

    user.sayHi = sayHi;

    user.sayHi();
    
    <button onclick="example2()">Run</button>
    </code></pre>

            <p>We can also declare a function (thereby a method) when the object is created, in a form more explicitly
                linked
                with the <code>key:value</code> pair approach:</p>
            <pre><code>
    let user = {
        name:"John",
        age: 30,
        sayHi: function(){
            alert("Hi!");
        }
    }

    user.sayHi();
    
    <button onclick="example3()">Run</button>
    </code></pre>

            <h3>Method shorthand</h3>
            <p>A slightly more efficient way of doing this is using a method shorthand. The above code can be re-written
                as:</p>
            <pre><code>
    let user = {
        name:"John",
        age: 30,
        sayHi(){
            alert("Hi!");
        }
    }

    user.sayHi();
    
    <button onclick="example4()">Run</button>
    </code></pre>


            <p>It's worth noting that the preceding examples appear to acheive exactly the same thing; they do, but
                there
                are nuances between the approaches that will become apparent when we look at inheritance. In almost all
                cases
                the shorter form is preferred. </p>

            <h3><code>this</code> in methods</h3>
            <p>Oftentimes methods need to access variables in their own obects. In the examples above, the
                <code>sayHi()</code> method
                may need to access the name of the User.
            </p>

            <p>To access the variable, the object can use the <code>this</code> keyword. The value of <code>this</code>
                is
                the object used to call the method. For example:</p>

            <pre><code>

    let user = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
        sayHi(){
            alert(`Hi ${this.name}!`);
        }
    }

    user.sayHi();
    
    <button onclick="example5()">Run</button>
    </code></pre>


            <h3>Arrow functions have no “this”</h3>
            <p>Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function,
                it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.</p>

            <p>For instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer user.sayHi() method:</p>

            <pre><code>
    let user = {
        firstName: "Ilya",
        sayHi() {
            let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
            arrow();
        }
    };

    user.sayHi(); // Ilya

</code></pre>
            <p>That’s a special feature of arrow functions, it’s useful when we actually do not want to have a separate
                this, but rather to take it from the outer context. Later in the chapter Arrow functions revisited we’ll
                go more deeply into arrow functions.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
                <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
                <li>Methods can reference the object as this.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The value of this is defined at run-time.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is
                    called.</li>
                <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
                <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call
                    is object.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow
                function, it is taken from outside.</p>

            name: "John",
            ref: this

            <ul>
                <li>read() prompts for two values and saves them as object properties with names a and b respectively.
                </li>
                <li>sum() returns the sum of saved values.</li>
                <li>mul() multiplies saved values and returns the result.</li>

    let calculator = {
    // ... your code ...
